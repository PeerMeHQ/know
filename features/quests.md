# ðŸ’° Quests (Bounties)

## Overview and Concept of Quests

"Quests", also referred to as "DAO Bounties", are tasks or projects assigned within a Collectives. This feature is designed to manage, assign, and incentivize tasks, encouraging active participation and the execution of successful proposals in the Collectives's community.

By setting up a Quest, the Collectives can incentivize the successful completion of tasks, leveraging the collective skills and efforts of its members. It's the decentralization of work and how we envision you **to earn a sustainable living in the Metaverse**.

## Modes of Quests

Quests operate under three different modes to cater to various needs and scenarios:

1. **Assignments**: In this mode, tasks are directly assigned to specific peers. This is best suited for straightforward tasks where the Collectives has identified peers who are suitable for the task.
2. **Matchmaking**: This mode provides flexibility by enabling peers to apply for tasks. The Collectives can then choose from a pool of applicants, making it ideal for tasks requiring specific skills or when the Collectives wants to explore untapped talents within the community.
3. **Competitions**: This mode stimulates a competitive environment where multiple peers vie for task completion. Rewards are distributed to the peer or peers who perform the best. This mode fosters innovation, creativity, and instills a healthy competitive spirit among peers.

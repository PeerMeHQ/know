# ðŸ’° Quests (Bounties)

## Overview and Concept of Quests

"Quests", also referred to as "Bounties", are tasks or projects assigned within a Team. This feature is designed to manage, assign, and incentivize tasks, encouraging active participation and the execution of successful proposals in the Teams's community.

By setting up a Quest, the Teams can incentivize the successful completion of tasks, leveraging the collective skills and efforts of its members. It's the decentralization of work and how we envision you **to earn a sustainable living in the Metaverse**.

## Modes of Quests

Quests operate under three different modes to cater to various needs and scenarios:

1. **Assignments**: In this mode, tasks are directly assigned to specific peers. This is best suited for straightforward tasks where the Teams has identified peers who are suitable for the task.
2. **Matchmaking**: This mode provides flexibility by enabling peers to apply for tasks. The Teams can then choose from a pool of applicants, making it ideal for tasks requiring specific skills or when the Teams wants to explore untapped talents within the community.
3. **Competitions**: This mode stimulates a competitive environment where multiple peers vie for task completion. Rewards are distributed to the peer or peers who perform the best. This mode fosters innovation, creativity, and instills a healthy competitive spirit among peers.

## How to Use Quests

### Creating a Quest

1. Navigate to the Quests section within your Teams.
2. Click on the "Create" button.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to define the task or project to be undertaken.

### Applying for a Quest

Remember, Quests aims to create an interactive, efficient, and productive Teams community by facilitating task management in a decentralized way.

## Fees

Understanding the fee structure is essential for participating in Quests. Below is how fees are applied:

- **Default Platform Fee**: A fee of 5% is charged on the total bounty amount upon successful completion of a Quest. For example, if a $100 bounty is completed, the platform fee would be $5, leaving a $95 reward for the bounty completer.

- **Reduced Fee for Boosted Teams**: For Teams boosted to Level Two, the fee is reduced to 2%.

- **Withdraw Fee for Incomplete Bounties**: A minimal fee of 0.05% is charged if a bounty is withdrawn before completion.

These fee structures are put in place to maintain a robust and sustainable ecosystem that rewards contribution and participation effectively.

# ðŸ§¾ Accounting (Automatic)

::: tip
This feature is an [Add-on](/teams/boosting.md#add-ons).
:::

## Introduction

Auto-Accounting helps [Teams](../teams/overview.md) save time and effort by recording and classifying outgoing transactions. It integrates seamlessly with [Quests](../features/bounties.md), [KYC](../features/kyc.md), and other PeerMe features.

## Features

### Automatic Monthly Reports

Monthly reports of recorded transactions are sent automatically via email to designated team members, ensuring everyone stays informed and financial tracking is simplified.

### Payment Classification

Classify outgoing payments with categories such as grants.

### KYC Integration

Integrate with KYC Providers to trigger KYC workflows based on user earnings. This ensures continuous compliance with regulatory requirements and automates your entire KYC process.

### Earn Module Integration

Our upcoming Earn module enables teams to distribute rewards to members proportional to their voting power. With Auto-Accounting, we automatically track and record disbursements made through the Earn module.

### Payment Intents Integration

Use the Payment Intents Module to preregister user earnings with specific conditions, such as KYC or time-based, disbursing payments when conditions are met.

### Future Features

We continuously develop new accounting features based on team needs and requests. Future features will be available to teams with Auto-Accounting enabled.

Auto-Accounting can be enabled from the PeerMe Feature Configurator of your Team.

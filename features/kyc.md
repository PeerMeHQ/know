::: tip
This feature is an [Add-on](/teams/boosting.md#add-ons)
:::

## Introduction

Our optional KYC (Know Your Customer) solution for [Teams](../teams/overview.md) ensures users are verified for certain features on our platform, such as [Quests](../features/bounties.md).

Once a user completes KYC on Peerme, they do not need to repeat the process for the same team or any other team until the KYC verification expires.

## Use cases

### Quests

To ensure that [Quest](../features/bounties.md) rewards are only distributed to verified individuals, KYC can be mandated. This helps confirm that only KYC-verified bounty hunters are eligible for rewards.

# ðŸ”’ Security

The society of tomorrow requires a solid foundation of security standards. For this, we have established rules and guidelines to make Collectives DAOs safe to use & participate for all members.

::: tip
Since your Collectives DAO is based on **its own smart contract**, PeerMe does not have any more access or control over voting processes than you do.

## Token Management Rights

**Requirement**: To start and run a public Collectives DAO with an existing token, we require the token owner to transfer token management rights to the Collectives smart contract. To make this easy, we provide a dedicated user interface to complete the transfer.

**Reason**: On MultiversX, a token manager (there can only be one per token) has complete control over their token. This means they can not only decide to freeze & wipe accounts but also freely mint & burn tokens as they like. A single person that can freely mint vote tokens out of thin air is a hazard to all members of a DAO and defeats all purposes of it as well.

**Consequences**: Collectives DAOs that don't have ownership and management rights for their vote token will periodically be set to operate in Private Mode. Members will also be informed about the risks.

## Special Token Roles

**Recommendation**: Before creating a Collectives DAO with an existing token, we recommend removing as many special roles for minting vote tokens as you deem sensible.

**Reason**: Accounts that are allowed to freely mint vote tokens are a hazard to all members of a Collectives DAO.

**Consequences**: We will tag potential risks accordingly.

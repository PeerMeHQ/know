# ðŸ’° Vault

The Vault contains all assets owned by the DAO. Since every DAO is fundamentally a smart contract, it can hold any assets available on the MultiversX blockchain.

You can find a Collectives's Vault by selecting the 'Vault' tab on the dedicated Collectives page.

## Deposit

Users can easily deposit funds to the DAO smart contract using the integrated **Deposit** button on the Vault tab.

The DAO smart contract itself is also marked as 'payable', which allows it to receive assets through a usual blockchain transaction.

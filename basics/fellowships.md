# ðŸŒ± Fellowship DAOs

> Fellowship DAOs are next-level communities that share a common goal

[DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) in Web3 are self-sufficient groups of people managed by a smart contract. They operate on the blockchain which ensures maximum trust, transparency & verifiability.

Superciety does all the heavy lifting of creating and running a DAO for you, so you and the DAO members can focus on what really matters to the company, project, or community.

::: tip Note
Since your Fellowship DAO is based on **its own smart contract**, Superciety does not have any more access or control over voting processes than you do.
:::

## Create a DAO

Creating a Fellowship DAO is a matter of a few minutes. All you need is an existing Elrond wallet and a little bit of [$SUPER](https://superciety.com/get-super).

To quickly get started:

1. Connect on [superciety.com](https://superciety.com)
2. Visit the Fellowship Setup page: [superciety.com/fellowships/create](https://superciety.com/fellowships/create)
3. Choose a name & a short description for your project or community
4. Submit the form and sign the prompted blockchain transaction

This process will create a new smart contract on the blockchain which serves as the foundation of your DAO.

### Voting Method

As a next step, you will be asked to select a method used for creating & voting on proposals.

The available methods are

- ESDT [new] - Use an entirely new [ESDT](https://docs.elrond.com/developers/esdt-tokens/) for voting
- ESDT [existing] - Use an existing [ESDT](https://docs.elrond.com/developers/esdt-tokens/) for voting
- NFT [existing] - Use an existing [NFT](https://docs.elrond.com/developers/nft-tokens/) collection for voting
- MultiSig - Continue without a token and vote based on [roles & permissions](/basics/permissions.md)

To ensure your DAO operates at the [highest level of security standards](/basics/security.md#transferring-token-management-rights), we require publicly visible DAOs to transfer token management rights to their Fellowship smart contracts.

## Set an Avatar

Similar to [SUPERIDs](/basics/superids.md), Fellowships can have an NFT Avatar too. In fact, they even use the same smart contract. In order to set or update a Fellowship's Avatar, create a proposal with a [Contract Call](/basics/actions.md#call-contract) action and select the **SUPERID** smart contract from the dropdown list:

![set avatar demo](/images/set-avatar-demo.png)

At the time of writing, the transaction to set an Avatar requires a payment of 50 [$SUPER](https://superciety.com/get-super). If your Fellowship is not a proud owner of [$SUPER](https://superciety.com/get-super) yet, you can easily [deposit](/basics/vault.md#deposit) some into your Fellowship's [Vault](/basics/vault.md).

## Add Social Links

Social links help users quickly find the official social platforms of your Fellowship. You can add & update them using a proposal [Ticket](/basics/actions.md#tickets) of the type 'Fellowship Socials Update':

<!-- ## Register a Username (Herotag)

Reserving a username (aka. Herotag) for the Fellowship smart contract is fairly easy using a proposal [Contract Call](/basics/actions.md#call-contract) action:

1. Create a new proposal and add a [Contract Call](/basics/actions.md#call-contract) action
2. Select your Fellowship smart contract in the dropdown field
3. Select the 'Register Dns' function
4. Enter the Fellowship smart contracts address
5. Choose a username (herotag) of your choice (**important!** make sure to add the **.elrond** suffix: myusername.elrond)
6. Propose and execute the proposal -->

## Register Custom Smart Contracts

Fellowships can register their own Smart Contracts to allow users to easily interact with them. The registration can be done by creating a Ticket of type **Contract Register** via a Proposal:

![register contract demo](/images/register-contract-demo.png)

Once verified, users can then add the Smart Contract to their Favorites on the Settings page and find them in the selection field of the Contract Call proposal action.

## Get Verified

Superciety verifies Fellowships to further ensure safety for our users when interacting with Fellowship DAOs in the ecosystem. They are more likely to appear on Explore pages.

> Verified Fellowships are displayed with a blue badge next to their name.

Requirements for Fellowship DAO verification:

- Must have an Avatar set
- Must have an official website set
- Must be public at the time of verification
- Must have an active community voting on their proposals
- Must have leaders with fully set up SUPERIDs
- Must not have previous violations of Superciety Rules

We reserve the right to change requirements and verification statuses any time without notice.

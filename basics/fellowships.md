# ðŸŒ± Fellowship DAOs

> Fellowship DAOs are next-level communities that share a common goal

DAOs in Web3 are self-sufficient groups of people managed by a smart contract. They operate on the blockchain which ensures maximum trust, transparency & verifiability.

## Create a DAO

Creating a Fellowship DAO is a matter of a few minutes. All you need is an existing Elrond wallet and a little bit of [$SUPER](https://superciety.com/get-super).

To quickly get started:

1. Connect on [superciety.com](https://superciety.com)
2. Visit the Fellowship Setup page: [superciety.com/fellowships/create](https://superciety.com/fellowships/create)
3. Choose a name & a short description for your project or community
4. Submit the form and sign the prompted blockchain transaction

This process will create a new smart contract on the blockchain which serves as the foundation of your DAO.

### Voting Method

As a next step, you will be asked to select a method used for creating & voting on proposals.

The available methods are

- ESDT [new] - Use an entirely new [ESDT](https://docs.elrond.com/developers/esdt-tokens/) for voting
- ESDT [existing] - Use an existing [ESDT](https://docs.elrond.com/developers/esdt-tokens/) for voting
- NFT [existing] - Use an existing [NFT](https://docs.elrond.com/developers/nft-tokens/) collection for voting
- MultiSig - Continue without a token and vote based on [roles & permissions](/basics/permissions.md)

## Set an Avatar

Similar to [SUPERIDs](/basics/superids.md), Fellowships can have an Avatar too. In fact, they even use the same smart contract

## Add Social Links

Social links help users to easily find official social platforms of your Fellowship. You can add & update them using a proposal [Ticket](/basics/actions.md#tickets) of the type 'Fellowship Socials Update'.

# ðŸ”‘ Roles & Permissions

## Role

A role is a tag used to group users together. Role names can be freely chosen by your Fellowship apart from the pre-defined **leader** role which is automatically assigned to the Fellowship creator.

For the naming of role names, we suggest adhering to the widely used [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) convention in singular word format. Here are some examples, so you don't spend time researching it:

- **leader** (singular; all lowercase)
- beta**T**ester (two words; no space; first word lowercase, capitalize second word)
- frontend**W**eb**D**eveloper (first word lowercase; capitalize second & third word)

### Decision Making

There are two types of decisions that role members can form together: **Text-only** proposals, and proposals that have [Actions](/basics/actions.md) attached. Since the latter can contain actions that could pose potential risks to a Fellowships [Vault](/basics/vault.md) or abuse other special privileges the smart contract has, Actions by default require a signature by the majority of role members for proposals to pass.

Text-only proposals are risk-free and therefore allow anyone owning the Fellowships vote token to vote and make their voice heard.

### About the Leader Role

> Progressive Decentralization â€” a process in which founding teams relinquish control by degrees, over time.

By default, only Leaders are allowed to attach [Actions](/basics/actions.md) to their proposals but they may release more and more control to other roles over time. A Fellowship with a single leader can add & execute Actions soley by themselves, but they may opt-in to assign further leaders to continue forming decisions together. A Fellowship with multiple leaders automatically enforces a MultiSig-like signer quorum for proposals.

## Permission

A permission is an ability to perform a certain action on the blockchain or inside the Superciety ecosystem using Tickets.

## Policy

A policy is the actual granting of a specific permission to a particular role. It defines a mapping between
the role and permission while also defining the parameters under which the role can invoke the
permission. The parameters include method: â€˜token weightâ€™, â€˜oneâ€™, â€˜allâ€™, or â€˜quorumâ€™ and other items like
the quorum count or vote duration (for token weight).

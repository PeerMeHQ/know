# ⚙️ Extensions

Extensions are made of Apps & Widgets. They allow developers to create custom integrations for their projects using a preset of tools provided by PeerMe.

## Apps

Apps appear in the app gallery during the proposal creation process.

Their main purpose is to provide a simple user interface for the proposer to construct smart contract calls on the blockchain but are not limited to it.

Learn more about creating an App in the [PeerMe Extensions GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PeerMeHQ/extensions).

## Widgets

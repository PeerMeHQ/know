# üßΩ Clean Code

> ‚ÄúAlways code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.‚Äù - Martin Golding

These are some practical guideliness for keeping the code nice and tidy.

## Clarity

- Keep functions and methods as short as possible. 20 to 30 lines should be a maximum.
- Only write (and commit) code that is used and necessary.
- Write expressive variable, function and class names.
- Only leave commented code if necessary and a description why it was commented.

## Simplicity

- Avoid unnecessary type annotations that can be derived by type inference.

## Brevity

- Avoid redundant & unnecessary code comments.

## Beauty

- Sort imports and use statements.

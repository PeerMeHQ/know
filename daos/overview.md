# ℹ️ Overview

> Fellowship DAOs are next-level communities that share a common goal

[DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) in Web3 are self-sufficient groups of people managed by a smart contract. They operate on the blockchain which ensures maximum trust, transparency & verifiability.

Superciety does all the heavy lifting of creating and running a DAO for you, so you and the DAO members can focus on what really matters to the company, project, or community.

::: tip Note
Since your Fellowship DAO is based on **its own smart contract**, Superciety does not have any more access or control over voting processes than you do.

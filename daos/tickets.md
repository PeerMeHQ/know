# üéüÔ∏è Tickets

Tickets are our way of enabling DAOs to manage off-chain data automatically and in a decentralized fashion. Multiple Tickets can be attached to a single proposal.

There are various Ticket types you can already make use of, with more being added as needed:

## Peering Name Update

Request an update to the Peering's name.

## Peering Description Update

Request an update to the Peerings's description.

## Peering Logo Update

Request an update to the Peerings's logo. You may upload any image of your choice using the provided form.

## Peering Header Image Update

Request an update to the Peerings cover image in the header of the DAO page. This feature requires [boosting](./boosting.md).

## Peering Socials Update

Request an update to the social links displayed below the Peering's name. You may add multiple of Ticket to a single proposal.

## Peering Tags Update

coming soon.

## Peering Child Associate

Request to designate another Peering DAO as a Peering Division, which will then be listed under the **Info** tab on our Peering page. This allows to put multiple Peerings into relation, as well as facilitate collaboration between the parent Peering and its Divisions. Additionally, a direct link to the parent Peering will be displayed on the Peering page, streamlining navigation and providing easy access to related DAOs.

## Event Create

coming soon.

## Contract Register

Request to register a smart contract to be used with later proposals.

## Roles Restrict Propose

Request the ability to restrict the creation of proposals to specific roles, for example, only allowing the **Leader** role to create proposals. This would be useful in scenarios where a new Peering seeks to start out with a more centralized structure, and decentralizes from there at their own pace.

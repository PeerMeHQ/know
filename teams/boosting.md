# ðŸš€ Boosting

## Overview

PeerMe DAOs are inherently robust, but **Boosting** elevates their capabilities. This includes enhanced features like Campfires, Comments, Media attachments, and [Social Bots](../features/bot.md).

Boosting is powered by **Energy** â€” a resource any user can contribute to a DAO, known as Teams on our platform. The greater the Energy input, the higher the level a Teams attains, unlocking more features.

For a comprehensive breakdown of levels and features, visit the [PeerMe DAO Boosting](https://peerme.io/teams/peerme-dao/boost) page.

## Energy: The Fuel of PeerMe

Energy is the currency of Boosting, directly linked to our SUPER token on the MultiversX blockchain: **1 ENERGY = 1 SUPER**.

Every Teams incurs a daily Energy cost, deducted in real-time. Users can opt to boost with tokens other than SUPER, which are seamlessly converted to SUPER via [xExchange](https://xexchange.com).

## Division Energy-Sharing

In scenarios where a project operates multiple Teams, these can be organized as [Divisions](../teams/setup.html#declare-a-division). To optimize costs, we've implemented Energy-sharing between a parent Teams and its Divisions:

- Divisions inherit the Boosting level of their parent Teams.
- Energy added to a Division directly boosts its parent Teams.

To balance this system and deter misuse, the base Energy cost of the parent Teams increases by 20% for the first three Divisions and by 10% for each additional Division.

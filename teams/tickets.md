# üéüÔ∏è Tickets

Tickets are our way of enabling DAOs to manage off-chain data automatically and in a decentralized fashion. Multiple Tickets can be attached to a single proposal.

There are various Ticket types you can already make use of, with more being added as needed:

## Teams Name Update

Request an update to the Teams's name.

## Teams Description Update

Request an update to the Teams's description.

## Teams Logo Update

Request an update to the Teams's logo. You may upload any image of your choice using the provided form.

## Teams Header Image Update

Request an update to the Teams cover image in the header of the DAO page. This feature requires [boosting](./boosting.md).

## Teams Socials Update

Request an update to the social links displayed below the Teams's name. You may add multiple of Ticket to a single proposal.

## Teams Tags Update

coming soon.

## Teams Child Associate

Request to designate another Teams DAO as a Teams Division, which will then be listed under the **Info** tab on our Teams page. This allows to put multiple Teams into relation, as well as facilitate collaboration between the parent Teams and its Divisions. Additionally, a direct link to the parent Teams will be displayed on the Teams page, streamlining navigation and providing easy access to related DAOs.

## Event Create

coming soon.

## Contract Register

Request to register a smart contract to be used with later proposals.

## Roles Restrict Propose

Request the ability to restrict the creation of proposals to specific roles, for example, only allowing the **Leader** role to create proposals. This would be useful in scenarios where a new Teams seeks to start out with a more centralized structure, and decentralizes from there at their own pace.

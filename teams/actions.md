# ▶️ Actions

Proposals can have optional Action attached. These include blockchain payments, external smart contract calls, roles & permission management, and Tickets with off-chain side effects.

The attached actions can only be executed if the proposal succeeds.

## Payments

A payment action refers to any assets being transferred from the DAO smart contract to another wallet.

## Call Contract

Contract call actions allow you to craft & execute on-chain transaction with any data to any destination address, which usually is a smart contract.

In order to use your custom smart contract, you may have to [regiser it](./setup.md#register-custom-smart-contracts) before.

## Manage Users

We also provide a UI to help you easily manage user roles & permissions. You can find more details on the dedicated [roles & permissions](./permissions.md) page.

## Tickets

Tickets solve the challenge of managing 'centralized' data in a decentralized fashion, through the proposal & voting processes you already know. Tickets allow you to e.g. manage info of your Team like its name, description, social links & more.
